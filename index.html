                <li>2019 release, “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.” Upon completion, the project would be re-christened as “Warzone.”</li>
                <li>Verdansk, the city, is similarly an extensively modified fictional city based heavily on a real one - Donetsk in Ukraine.</li>
                <li>The title permits multiplayer combat online among 150 players set in the city of Verdansk, a fictional place. </li>
                <li>There was approximately 1 million~ to 3 million people playing Warzone daily. </li>
                <li>It zoomed to popularity, topping over 100 million players a little over a year from its release and becoming one of the most played games on the planet.</li>
                <li>Beyond the skyscrapers of the cityscape that became known in the game as Downtown, they added other distinct locations, like an airport and a train station. Then, they drew from familiar multiplayer maps from the Modern Warfare franchise, an approach they appreciated in Blackout’s map. They weaved in the airplane husks of Scrap Yard, Broadcast’s TV station and the prison building of Petropavlovsk Gulag, among others. It combined eye-catching new landmarks with familiar callbacks to the Call of Duty franchise.</li>
                <li>On December 8, 2021, Vanguard's integration with Warzone kicked off and Verdansk was replaced with Caldera as the main battle royale map.</li>
